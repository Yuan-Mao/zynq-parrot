Support for rapid design iteration of BlackParrot on Zynq FPGAs.

See cosim directory for more instructions.

Suggested projects for contributors:

- We would like to have an open-source standin for the Xilinx AXI-to-JTAG debug bridge
- So we can support OpenOCD over AXI on Zynq: https://review.openocd.org/c/openocd/+/6594
